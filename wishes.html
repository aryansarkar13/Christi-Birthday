					From solving questions together,
To sharing tiffin and then rushing to the Computer lab after lunch, 
From those long morning assemblies to Manisha ma'am ki class m first bench par chalk dust ki baarish.
Making notes, discussing paper and then giving entrances together and facing the results!
The last two years of my school life have been amazing with you! 
Now, that you are my senior..I wish the bond remains the same forever! 
Happy Birthday Christi! 🎂
May you get all that you wish for!♥️

					Heyy, Happiest Birthday To You. Honestly, I Don't Know Much About You Like Others And Also Never Got The Chance To. But Yess, One Thing I'm Certain About Is That You Are One Of Those Who Is There For Everyone Through Their Good And Bad, One Of Those Who Adds To The Joy And Keeps the Gang Going, Be It Scribble Or Writing Everybody's Names On Easter Eggs(Thank you kyunki mere naam ki spelling sahi thi). And People Count On You For That. Cause You're A Good Hooman!
PS - Who Called You "Christi Mathai" And Not "Crispy Mithai". Cause You're Mstt And Sweet.
PPS - Really Sorry For That Pun!
